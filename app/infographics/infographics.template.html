            Newton's method, also called the Newton-Raphson method, is a root-finding algorithm that uses the first few terms of the Taylor series of a function f(x) in the vicinity of a suspected root.
            Newton's method is sometimes also known as Newton's iteration, although in this work the latter term is reserved to the application of Newton's method for computing square roots.

                <p>Isaac Newton is considered one of the most important scientists in history. During his lifetime Newton developed the theory of gravity, the laws of motion, a new type of mathematics called calculus, and made breakthroughs in the area of optics such as the reflecting telescope.</p>

                    Raphson's most notable work is Analysis Aequationum Universalis, which was published in 1690 that contains a method, now known as the Newton–Raphson method, for approximating the roots of an equation.
                    Raphson's version of the method is simpler than Newton's, and for this reason it is Raphson's version of the method, rather than Newton's, that is to be found in textbooks today.

            <p>The idea of the method is as follows: one starts with an initial guess which is reasonably close to the true root,
                then the function is approximated by its tangent line, which can be computed using the tools of calculus, and one
                computes the x-intercept of this tangent line, which is easily done with elementary algebra.
                This x-intercept will typically be a better approximation to the function's root than the original guess, and the method
                can be iterated.</p>

                    Suppose \(f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is a differentiable function defined on the interval \([a,b]\) with values in the real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\).
                    The formula for converging on the root can be easily derived. Suppose we have some current approximation \(x_n\).  Then we can derive the formula for a better approximation,
                    \(x_{n+1}\) by referring to the diagram on the right. The equation of the tangent line to the curve \(y={f(x)}\) at the point \(x=x_n\) is $$y = {f'(x_n)(x-x_n)+f(x_n)},$$
                    where \(f'\) denotes the derivative of the function \(f\).
                    The \(x\)-intercept of this line (the value of \(x\) such that \(y=0\) is then used as the next approximation to the root, \(x_{n+1}\). In other words, setting \(y\) to zero and \(x\)
                    to \(x_{n+1}\) gives $$0 = {f'(x_n)(x_{n+1}-x_n)+f(x_n)}$$. Solving for \(x_{n+1}\) gives $$x_{n+1} = { x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} }.$$.

            This algorithm is first in the class of Householder's methods, succeeded by Halley's method. The method can also be extended to complex functions and to systems of equations.
            Newton's method is an extremely powerful technique—in general the convergence is quadratic: as the method converges on the root, the difference between the root and the approximation is squared (the number of accurate digits roughly doubles) at each step.
