    <h1>Newton-Raphson Method</h1>
    <p>Newton's method, also called the Newton-Raphson method,
        is a root-finding algorithm that uses the first few terms
        of the Taylor series of a function f(x) in the vicinity of a suspected root.
        Newton's method is sometimes also known as Newton's iteration,
        although in this work the latter term is reserved to the application
        of Newton's method for computing square roots.</p>

        <p>Isaac Newton is considered one of the most important scientists in history.
            Even Albert Einstein said that Isaac Newton was the smartest person that ever lived.
            During his lifetime Newton developed the theory of gravity, the laws of motion (which became the basis for physics),
            a new type of mathematics called calculus,
            and made breakthroughs in the area of optics such as the reflecting telescope.

        <p>Raphson's most notable work is Analysis Aequationum Universalis, which was published in 1690.
            It contains a method, now known as the Newton–Raphson method, for approximating the roots of an equation.
            Isaac Newton had developed a very similar formula in his Method of Fluxions, written in 1671,
            but this work would not be published until 1736, nearly 50 years after Raphson's Analysis.
            However, Raphson's version of the method is simpler than Newton's,
            and is therefore generally considered superior. For this reason,
            it is Raphson's version of the method, rather than Newton's,
            that is to be found in textbooks today.1671 it was not published until 1736,
            so Raphson published the result nearly 50 years before Newton.
